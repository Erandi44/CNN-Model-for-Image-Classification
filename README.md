This project involves building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the classification of eight different types of blood cells using TensorFlow. The dataset used in this project was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unclesamulus/blood-cells-image-dataset![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e17ff360-1fca-4b31-83a3-a14b25b48537)
) and contains 17,092 high-quality images of normal blood cells captured with the CellaVision DM96 analyzer at the Core Laboratory of the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona.

## Dataset Information
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unclesamulus/blood-cells-image-dataset![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad80cbe1-7159-44bb-b87e-d34a0c50399c)
) contains a total of 17,092 images of individual blood cells, all annotated by expert clinical pathologists. The images are organized into the following eight classes:

1. Neutrophils
2. Eosinophils
3. Basophils
4. Lymphocytes
5. Monocytes
6. Immature granulocytes (promyelocytes, myelocytes, and metamyelocytes)
7. Erythroblasts
8. Platelets (or thrombocytes)
